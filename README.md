MiniVT is a simple showcase of Intel CPU's virtualization technology VT-x on the Windows platform.

## Introduction

- MiniVT is an open-source Windows system driver developed over Intel CPU's virtualization technology, VT-x.
- The project was inspired by Ddvp from JoenChen. Huge shout out for his work. üëè
- The driver is primarily written in C/C++ and x86-64 ASM.
- It provides a minimal implementation of the VT-x technology on the Windows operating system.
- When loaded, the driver enables virtualization of the OS and acts as the VMM (Virtual Machine Monitor), becoming a system hypervisor.
- It allows the control over access, execution, and privileges of the system's registers, memory, and many instructions.

- The driver also provides an easy framework for various types of virtualization.
  - If needed, you can implement other parts like Extended Page Table (EPT), which enables kernel-level monitoring and control of memory operations.

## System Requirements

Early test results have shown that this driver can run on the following systems:

- Windows XP (with Service Pack 3)
- Windows 7 (with Service Pack 1)
- Windows 10 Version 1607 (build 14393)
